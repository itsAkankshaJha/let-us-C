## C- Preprocessor :sunglasses:
In C , Preprocessor is a program that processes our source program before it is passed to the compiler.<br>

There are several steps involved from the stage of writing a program to its execution which altogether are called as BUILD PROCESS.<br>
The C program that we write is called as *source code* <br>
The Preprocessor works on the source code and creates **Expanded Source Code** <br>
The preprocessor offers several features called **preprocessor directives**. In C , The preprocessor directives give instruction to the compiler to preprocess the information before *actual compilation starts*.<br>
:information_desk_person: Preprocessor directives always **begin with #** symbol AND **don't end** with any semicolon(;).<br>

There are four types of preprocessor directives in C : :point_right:
- Macros
- File Inclusion
- Conditional Compilation
- Miscellaneous directives

#### Macros

Macros are a piece of code given with some name in a program.
Whenever this name is encountered by the compiler the compiler replaces the name with the actual piece of code<br>
Begin with "# define" <br>
**examples** <br>

        #define max 10 <br>
        #define sum(a,b) (a+b)  // macro with arguements<br>
        #define area(x) (3.14* x *x)

- Macros can be split into multiple lines, with a ‘\’ (backslash) present at the end of each line<br>

       #include <windows.h>
       void gotoxy ( short int col, short int row ) ;
       # define HLINE for ( i = 0 ; i < 79 ; i++ ) \
        printf ( "%c", 196 ) ;
       # define VLINE( X, Y ) 
       { \
        gotoxy ( X, Y ) ; \
        printf ( "%c", 179 ) ; \
       }

 - Be careful not to leave a blank between the macro template and its argument while defining the macro .
 - The entire macro expansion should be enclosed within parentheses. 
 ## MACRO VS FUNCTIONS
 
              #define area(x) (3.14* x *x)
              
 In the above example, a macro was used to calculate the area of the circle. As we know, even a function can be written to calculate the area 
 of the circle. Though macro calls are ‘like’ function calls, they are not really the same things <br>
 
 In a macro call, the preprocessor replaces the macro template with its macro expansion. While, in a function call the control is passed to a function along with certain 
arguments, some calculations are performed in the function and a useful value is returned back from the function. <br>

##### when is it best to use macros with arguments and when is it better to use a function?
- If we use a macro hundred times in a program, the macro expansion goes into our source code at hundred different places, thus increasing the program size. 
- if a function is used, then even if it is called from hundred different places in the program, it would take the same amount of space in the program .
- passing arguments to a function and getting back the returned value does take time and would therefore slow down the program
- Macros  have already been expanded and placed in the source code before compilation. 

 ##### WHAT TO CHOOSE 
 - If memory space in the machine in which the program is being executed is less then we can use functions instead of macros. By doing so, the program may run slower, but will      need less memory space.
 - If our micro is simple , then we can use it . on the other hand ,if it is fairly large then using a function makes sense

### File Inclusion<br>
This directive causes one file to be included in another. It simply causes the entire contents of filename to be inserted into the source code at that point in the program.<br>
##### Why include a file ?
There are some functions and some macro definitions that we need almost in all programs that we write. These commonly needed functions and macro definitions can be stored in a file, and that file can be included in every program we write, which would add all the statements in this file to our program as if we have typed them in.<br>

#####   We can also create our own library of functions , the functions are defined in a ".c" file and their corresponding prototype declarations and macros are declared in a ".h" file. 
:sunglasses: the .h extension stands for ‘header file’, because it contains statements which when included go to the head of your program. The prototypes of all the library functions are grouped into different categories and then stored in different header files. For example, prototypes of all 
mathematics related functions are stored in the header file ‘math.h’.
- There are two ways to include files ( 2nd one is used mostly)

   ###  #include "filename" (#include "math.h")
     This command would look for the file math.h in the current directory as well as the specified list of directories as mentioned in the include 
     search path that might have been set up .
     
   ### #include < filename>  (#include <math.h>) 
     This command would look for the file math.h in the specified list of directories only.

### Conditional Compilation<br>
Conditional Compilation directives help to compile a specific portion of the program or let us skip compilation of some specific part of the program based on some conditions.<br>
 ####  #ifdef - #endif  : this   #ifdef - #else -  #endif is similar to the ordinary if - else in C
 This directive is the simplest conditional directive. This block is called a conditional group. The controlled text will get included in the preprocessor output iff the macroname is defined. The controlled text inside a conditional will embrace preprocessing directives. They are executed only if the conditional succeeds. You can nest these in multiple layers, but they must be completely nested. In other words, ‘#endif’ always matches the nearest ‘#ifdef’ .
 - It is used to “comment out” obsolete lines of code .
 - A more sophisticated use of #ifdef has to do with making the programs portable, i.e., to make them work on two totally different computers
 
            int main( )
            {
            # ifdef INTEL
             code suitable for an Intel PC;
           # else
             code suitable for a Motorola PC
           # endif
             code common to both the computers
            }
- Sometimes, instead of #ifdef, the #ifndef directive is used. The **#ifndef (which means ‘if not defined’)** works exactly opposite to #ifdef <br>

#### #if, #else and #elif: These directives works together and control compilation of portions of the program using some conditions. 
- The #if directive can be used to test whether an expression evaluates to a non-zero value or not. If the result of the expression is non-zero, then subsequent lines upto a #else, #elif or #endif are compiled, otherwise they are skipped .

           # if x>0
            x is +ve ;
           # elif x<0
             x is -ve
           # else
             x is zero
           # endif
 
 #### #undef : This is used to undefine a macro that has been earlier #defined.
            #undef max
            
 #### #pragma Directive : This directive is another special-purpose directive that you can use to turn on or off certain features.
 -  #pragma startup and #pragma exit : These directives allow us to specify functions that are called upon program startup (before main( )) or program exit
 
               #include <stdio.h>
               void fun1( ) ;
               void fun2( ) ;
               # pragma startup fun1
               # pragma exit fun2
              int main( )
              {  printf ( "Inside main\n" ) ; return 0 ;}

              void fun1( )
             { printf ( "Inside fun1\n" ) ;}
              void fun2( )
              { printf ( "Inside fun2\n" ) ;}
              // output : Inside fun1 Inside main  Inside fun2

#### There are many steps involved in converting a C program into an executable form.

 ##### Preprocessing
During this step, the C source code is expanded based on the preprocessor directives like #define, #include, #ifdef, etc. The expanded 
source code is stored in an intermediate file with .i extension. Thus, if our source code is stored in PR1.C then the expanded source code is stored in PR1.I. The expanded source code is also in C language. Note that the ‘.I’ extension may vary from one compiler to another.

##### Compilation 
The expanded source code is then passed to the compiler, which identifies the syntax errors in the expanded source code. These errors are displayed along with warnings .
If the expanded source code is error-free, then the compiler translates the expanded source code in C, into an equivalent assembly language program. Different processors (CPUs) support different set of assembly instructions, using which they can be programmed. 

##### Assembling
The job of the Assembler is to translate .ASM program into Relocatable Object code. Thus, if the assembly language instructions are present in 
PR1.ASM then the relocatable object code gets stored in PR1.OBJ.

##### Linking
Linking is the final stage in creating an executable program.
- Find definition of all external functions—those which are defined inother .OBJ files, and those which are defined in Libraries (like printf( )). 
-  Find definition of all global variables—those which are defined in other .obj files

#### Loading
Once the .EXE file is created and stored on the disk, it is ready for execution. When we execute it, it is first brought from the disk into the 
memory (RAM) by an Operating System component called Program Loader .
