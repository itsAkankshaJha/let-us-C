### Arrays

Ordinary variables (the ones which we have used so far) are capable of holding only one value at a time . 
However, there are situations in which we would want to store more than one value at a time in a single variable.

#### Example :
suppose we wish to arrange the percentage marks obtained by 100 students in ascending order. In such a case, we have two options to store these marks in memory: <br>
- (a) Construct 100 variables to store percentage marks obtained by 100 different students, i.e., each variable containing one student’s marks.
- (b) Construct one variable (called array or subscripted variable) capable of storing or holding all the hundred values.

###### the second alternative is better. A simple reason for this is, it would be much easier to handle one variable than handling 100 different variables.

#### An array is a collective name given to a group of ‘similar quantities'(contagious memory location)
#### An array is also known as a subscripted variable.
       int per[5];
       per={ 56,78,95,89,90};
 
  In C, the counting of elements begins with 0 and not with 1
  
  
  ### Array Declaration
          int marks[ 30 ] ; // this is an array of 30 integers 
          // The bracket ( [ ] ) tells the compiler that we are dealing with an array
          
  ### Accessing Elements of an Array
 Individual elements in the array can be referred with subscript, the number in the brackets following the array name. This number specifies the element’s position in the array.
 All the array elements are numbered, starting with 0. 
 Here per[0] is first element and per[2] is third element **not third element**
 
 ### Entering Data into an Array
       
       int marks[30];
       for ( i = 0 ; i <= 29 ; i++ )
        {
         printf ( "Enter marks " ) ;
         scanf ( "%d", &marks[ i ] ) ;
         }
 ### Array Initialization
 - Till the array elements are not given any specific values, they are supposed to contain garbage values.
 - If the array is initialised where it is declared, mentioning the dimension of the array is optional as in the 2nd and 3rd examples
 
             int num[ 6 ] = { 2, 4, 12, 5, 45, 5 } ;
             int n[ ] = { 2, 4, 12, 5, 45, 5 } ;
             float press[ ] = { 12.3, 34.2, -23.4, -11.3 } ;
             
  ### Array Elements in Memory
           int arr[ 8 ] ;
- In this case ,  32 bytes get immediately reserved in memory, 4 bytes each for the 8 integers .
- And since the array is not being initialized, all eight values present in it would be garbage values , due to default storage class as auto![2021-06-14 23_25_08-Let us C pdf - Personal - Microsoft​ Edge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72215893/121937080-eeffd000-cd67-11eb-91c6-15a11041bf13.png)

### Bounds Checking. <br>
there is no check to see if either  the subscript used for an array exceeds the size of the array or if it is less than zero <br>

there will be no error message to warn you that you are going beyond the array size but the program may give false outputs.

### Passing Array Elements to a Function 
Array elements can be passed to a function by calling the function by value, or by reference. In the call by value, we pass values of array 
elements to the function, whereas in the call by reference, we pass addresses of array elements to the function.
